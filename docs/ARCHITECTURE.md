# Architecture Blueprint

## 1) Current State
- Core logic is implemented directly in a few classes.
- Pricing logic is hard-coded in `BookStoreEngine`.
- File I/O uses direct stream handling.

## 2) Target Architecture (Layered)

### Domain Layer
Contains pure business logic:
- Entities/value objects
- Domain services (pricing, inventory, checkout)
- Promotion rule abstractions

### Application Layer
Coordinates use cases:
- Commands/handlers (e.g., `CreateOrder`, `AdjustStock`)
- DTO mapping
- Validation orchestration

### Infrastructure Layer
External concerns:
- File persistence implementation
- (future) database adapters
- Logging and serialization

### Interface Layer (future)
- CLI / Web API / UI front-end
- Converts user requests into application commands

## 3) Design Principles
- Dependency inversion (domain independent of infrastructure).
- Small interfaces + composition.
- Explicit rule objects over `if/else` pyramids for discounts.
- Deterministic and testable domain behavior.

## 4) Proposed Project Evolution
- `BookStore/Domain/*`
- `BookStore/Application/*`
- `BookStore/Infrastructure/*`
- `BookStoreTests/Unit/*`
- `BookStoreTests/Integration/*`

(Physical folder split can be incremental without immediate project fragmentation.)

## 5) Key Technical Decisions
1. Keep monetary values as `decimal` (not `int`).
2. Introduce typed exceptions for domain validation.
3. Encapsulate pricing rules behind a promotion interface.
4. Use repository interfaces to isolate storage concerns.
5. Preserve backward compatibility where feasible during refactors.

## 6) Risk Areas and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Breaking existing tests during model expansion.  
  **Mitigation:** Add characterization tests before refactoring.

- **Risk:** Discount complexity growth.  
  **Mitigation:** Rule engine with ordered, independently tested rules.

- **Risk:** File format instability.  
  **Mitigation:** Versioned schema for persisted records.

## 7) Companion Documents
- Use `USE_CASES.md` for application-level boundaries and command/query definitions.
- Use `PRICING_SPEC.md` for canonical pricing behavior.
- Use `PERSISTENCE_SCHEMA.md` for file layout and JSON contracts.
- Use `ERROR_MODEL.md` for exception taxonomy.
- Use `ADR/` for stable architecture decisions.
