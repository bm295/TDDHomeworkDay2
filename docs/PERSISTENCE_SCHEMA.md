# Persistence Schema

## Purpose
This document defines the initial file-based persistence contract for the BookStore application. It is the source of truth for file layout, JSON schema, versioning, and corruption handling.

## Scope
- Local file storage only
- JSON document format
- Single-process write assumption
- Schema version `1`

## Storage Layout
Repositories store data under a local `data/` folder.

Initial files:
- `data/books.json`
- `data/inventory.json`
- `data/orders.json`

Rules:
- Writers create the `data/` directory on first write if it does not exist.
- Readers do not create files as a side effect.
- Missing files are treated as empty datasets.

## Common Envelope
Each file contains a JSON object with this envelope:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "generatedAtUtc": "2026-03-26T00:00:00Z",
  "items": []
}
```

Envelope rules:
- `schemaVersion` is required.
- `generatedAtUtc` is required and stored in ISO 8601 UTC format.
- `items` is required and must be an array.
- Readers may ignore unknown properties.
- Writers emit only documented properties.

## Book Records
Stored in `data/books.json`.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "generatedAtUtc": "2026-03-26T00:00:00Z",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "isbn": "9780131103627",
      "title": "The C Programming Language",
      "author": "Brian W. Kernighan; Dennis M. Ritchie",
      "category": "Programming",
      "basePrice": 49.99,
      "isActive": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Book rules:
- `id` is required and must be a positive integer.
- `isbn`, `title`, `author`, and `category` are required strings.
- `basePrice` is required and must be greater than or equal to zero.
- `isActive` is required.
- Duplicate `id` values are invalid.
- Duplicate `isbn` values are invalid.

## Inventory Records
Stored in `data/inventory.json`.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "generatedAtUtc": "2026-03-26T00:00:00Z",
  "items": [
    {
      "bookId": 1,
      "quantityOnHand": 12,
      "reorderThreshold": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

Inventory rules:
- `bookId` is required and must reference an existing book.
- `quantityOnHand` is required and must be greater than or equal to zero.
- `reorderThreshold` is required and must be greater than or equal to zero.
- Duplicate `bookId` values are invalid.

## Order Records
Stored in `data/orders.json`.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "generatedAtUtc": "2026-03-26T00:00:00Z",
  "items": [
    {
      "orderId": "0d9f9824-cc7f-4e70-bf4a-a61e22d6920e",
      "createdAtUtc": "2026-03-26T00:00:00Z",
      "lines": [
        {
          "bookId": 1,
          "quantity": 2,
          "unitPrice": 49.99,
          "lineDiscount": 5.00,
          "lineTotal": 94.98
        }
      ],
      "subtotal": 99.98,
      "discountTotal": 5.00,
      "grandTotal": 94.98
    }
  ]
}
```

Order rules:
- `orderId` is required and must be unique.
- `createdAtUtc` is required and must be in UTC.
- `lines` is required and must contain at least one line.
- Each line requires `bookId`, `quantity`, `unitPrice`, `lineDiscount`, and `lineTotal`.
- `quantity` must be greater than zero.
- `unitPrice`, `lineDiscount`, and `lineTotal` must be greater than or equal to zero.
- `subtotal`, `discountTotal`, and `grandTotal` must be greater than or equal to zero.
- `grandTotal` must equal `subtotal - discountTotal`.

## Serialization Rules
- Encoding: UTF-8
- Date/time format: ISO 8601 with `Z`
- Numbers use JSON numeric literals, not strings
- Repositories read and write the whole document in v1

## Error Handling
Repository read rules:
- Missing file returns an empty dataset.
- Malformed JSON throws `MalformedDataException`.
- Unsupported `schemaVersion` throws `UnsupportedSchemaVersionException`.
- Duplicate identifiers or invariant violations in stored data throw `MalformedDataException`.

Repository write rules:
- Writers must serialize to a temporary file and replace the target file atomically when possible.
- Writers must not leave a truncated primary file after a failed write.
- Validation occurs before the final file replacement step.

## Concurrency and Migration Assumptions
- Single-process writes are assumed in v1.
- Cross-process locking is out of scope for v1.
- Future schema versions may add fields, but version `1` readers are not required to support future versions.
- Any migration from version `1` to a later version must be explicit and tested.

## Non-Goals
- Database storage
- Incremental append-only journals
- Binary serialization
- Multi-file transactions across machines
